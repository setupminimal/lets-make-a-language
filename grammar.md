## Introduction

## Phonology

Here is a chart of the consonants present in the language:

|              | Bi-labial | Labio-dental | Alveolar | Velar |
| Plosive      | p pj      |              | t tj     | k kj  |
| Nasal        | m mj      |              | n nj     | ŋ     |
| Fricatives   |           | f fj         | s sj     | x     |
| Approximants |           | l/r          |          | j     |

Note that this language does not distinguish voicing, but does distinguish palatalization.

r is tapped.

Vowels distinguish roundedness.

|      | Front | Mid | Back |
| High | i y   |     |      |
| Mid  | e ø   |     | ɤ o  |
| Low  |       | a æ |      |

In some situations, vowels exhibit harmony by roundedness.

## Morphology

Syllables have the following form: (T)DV(Q)

where
  T = Any non-palatalized consonant
  D = Any consonant that's not x
  Q = One of n, f, s, x, ŋ
  
### Rewrite rules

Any two consecutive nasal sounds become n

If two of the same consonant would touch (ignoring palatalization), they fuse.

### Derivational Morphology

| Diminutive     | -fjisi        |
| Augmentive     | -fopo         |
| Common tool    | -jex          |
| Related animal | -lmes         |
| Material       | -pem          |
| Negative       | kje-          |
| Made of        | ko-           |
| Collection     | Reduplication |

Reduplication:

Duplicate the first (few?) syllable of the word, swapping palatalization.

## Syntax

Word order is completely free -- bringing a word to the beginning of a sentence emphasizes it but does not change the meaning.

Verbs are marked for:
  - Work/non-work
  - Aspect
  - Tense
  - Mood/Evidentiality
  - Participation in a subclause
  
Markings on verbs are in form of agglutanative suffixes.

| Work     | -lø  |
| Non-work | -søn |

|                     | Interrupted | Uninterrupted |
| Once                | -ka         |               |
| Ongoing             | -skati      | -sati         |
| Habitual (regular)  | -pelki      | -pel          |
| Habitual (seasonal) | --------    | -xel          |

| Non-Future | rounded vowels   |
| Future     | unrounded vowels |

| Indicative, personally observed | -ŋem                                |
| Indicative, hearsay             | -ŋolan                              |
| Subjunctive                     | ???                                 |
| Interrogative                   | Low tone near beginning of sentence |
| Prommisory                      | ???                                 |
| Inferential                     | ???                                 |
| Imperative/Jussive              | -kon                                |

If a verb is part of a subclause, it gains the ending -tepi

Nouns all take case marking, in the form of suffixes. If a noun performs multiple roles in a sentence, it is permissible to have multiple case markings.

| Causitive    | -los   |
| Subject      | -lep   |
| Object       | -letin |
| Vocative     | -sja   |
| Genitive     | -fjan  |
| Locative     | -ŋem   |
| Instrumental | -jex   |
| Evidential   | -ŋolan |
| Clausal      | -nøl   |

Pronouns indicate case, person, and number. They take the normal case markings.

|     | Single | Paucal | Plural |
| 1st | pe     | pje    | nix    |
| 2nd | fem    | fjem   | som    |
| 3rd | ko     | ko     | kos    |

Exceptions:
pe + lep = pelep = pep
fem + sja = femsja = fesja
somsja = somtja

### Clauses

Clauses are marked with a special marker on the verb and nouns participating in it. Nested clauses can double-up the markers.
